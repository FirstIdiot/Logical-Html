# Logical HTML
## Adding Logic to HTML so we can use it as Programming language

## How to use it (for fun)
Easy just import every file in `src` directory (making sure index.js is the last one)

and start using the elements

## Right now we have
* variable (can be used as c-variable)
* if statement (can be used as c-if)

## Have fun trying this stupid idea and Challenge yourself make it something

## We are accepting all kind of elements immediately without questioning or even reviewing so get yourself comfortable and go play around

### **Btw this is just a proof of how web components are strong and powerful**

# **Intended only for learning, Exploring, playing, and having fun and any serious use will be considered a form of witchcraft (if you can even use it )**
